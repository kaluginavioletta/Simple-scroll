<h1>Amazing scrollbar with pink and dark themes and transitions to these themes. </h1>

Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹

This is my first project I've followed since a blogger who did something like this (still haven't found a video, so I'm sorry if I don't provide a link) using JavaScript (this is new to me)ðŸ˜…

That blogger did with a dark theme (and I repeated his concept on how to do it), and I created a pink theme with transitions to these given themes.

Although it's useless, I've gained some experience with JavaScript and plan to work with it in the futureðŸ˜»
